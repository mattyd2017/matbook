this simple facebook clone is a basic demo of something i have been trying to do for a while now it first came about as a uni 
project an ability to make a simple threaded message board whilst this isn't linked into a database as yet which i will be working 
on so that rather then just been session storage it will be linked to a database and will remeber your posts and whilst it isn't a 
personal expereince or has any threads in regard to different pages for different subjects the concept was about been able to leave 
a comment and a reply this was made using signalr and ajax and a basic model data binding
